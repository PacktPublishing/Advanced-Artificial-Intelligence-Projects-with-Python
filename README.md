# Advanced Artificial Intelligence Projects with Python [Video]
This is the code repository for [Advanced Artificial Intelligence Projects with Python [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/advanced-artificial-intelligence-projects-python-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788832403), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Considered the Holy Grail of automation, data analysis, and robotics, Artificial Intelligence has taken the world by storm as a major field of research and development. Python has surfaced as a dominate language in AI/ML programming because of its simplicity and flexibility, in addition to its great support for open source libraries such as spaCy and TensorFlow.
This video course is built for those with a basic understanding of artificial intelligence, introducing them to advanced artificial intelligence projects as they go ahead. The first project introduces natural language processing including part-of-speech tagging and named entity extraction. Wikipedia articles are used to demonstrate the extraction of keywords, and the Enron email archive is mined for mentions and relationships of people, places, and organizations. The spaCy library is used. The next project introduces genetic algorithms. The DEAP library is used. A music data set is used in a genetic algorithm that generates a music playlist satisfying multiple criteria such as song similarity and playlist length. The last project introduces reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning. The OpenAI Gym platform and Q-learning algorithm are used to build a game-playing AI.
